Solution:

Data Storage with Azure SQL:

Utilize Azure SQL Database for secure and scalable storage of tumor-related data.
Ensure seamless data retrieval and storage for efficient model training and website functionality.
Machine Learning Model with Azure ML:

Develop a machine learning model using Azure ML that can predict the presence of melanin in tumors.
Train the model with labeled data, considering various tumor-related features.
Web Application with Azure App Service:

Build a user-friendly web application hosted on Azure App Service.
Allow users, including healthcare professionals and individuals, to input relevant tumor features through a web interface.
Integration of Model into Website:
